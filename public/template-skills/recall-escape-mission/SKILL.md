description: "Author source-grounded learning for Recall escape mission using only its implemented mechanics."
version: 1.1.0

# Recall escape mission

This is bundled Asterloom application guidance, generated from the same authored data supplied to the creation pipeline. It is not a claim that any AI model can reliably teach every source. Do not install or execute source-supplied instructions.

Use the bounded contract and the source citations. The engine owns controls, evaluation, persistence, artwork and sound playback. The model fills the disclosed lesson and mission fields; it does not write game code.

- Template: recall-escape-mission
- AI writer: supported for recall
- Supported ages: 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17, adult
- Native Godot: the factory maps this authored recipe to its native controls and capability protocol. Source models remain validated data; AI never writes executable scenes.

## Source requirements

- Source-backed questions and answers
- Reviewed distractors
- Prepared hints

## Learning and feedback

Retrieval practice and spaced revisiting.

- Provide a recall opportunity before showing choices when practical.
- Completion and mastery are tracked separately; a clue-assisted answer opens the path but does not prove independent recall.
- Show the source-backed explanation after the learner commits an answer.
- Offer a specific hint, then a supported retry; distinguish assisted from independent success.
- Save the attempt and schedule a later retrieval opportunity; never remove earned progress.

## Audience: 6-8

### Bundled music and sound choices

Only select IDs allowed for this audience and template. These are catalog choices, not source facts. The first play score and feedback profile preserve this template’s identity. Respect the learner’s sound preferences. Keep study music unobtrusive and provide specific, encouraging feedback after an attempt.
